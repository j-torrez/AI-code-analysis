# Software Engineer Project - Web Application Code Quality and  Converter

The primary objective of this project is to develop a web application that facilitates code
conversion between programming languages, leveraging the ChatGPT API. In addition, the
application aims to provide robust code debugging and code quality checking features. This tool
will assist developers in seamlessly transitioning code across different languages, improving code
quality, and identifying potential bugs early in the development process.
